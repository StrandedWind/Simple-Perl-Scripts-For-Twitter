   These simple scripts are meant to make Twitter accessible 
'the unix way'. These snippets of code are simple to read, 
even for someone who doesn't program in perl, and they easily 
integrate with grep, awk, sed, and so forth.

   The only dependency is Net::Twitter. All one has to do 
assuming perl is properly installed is to become root, start 
the cpan shell, and 'install Net::Twitter'.

   If I get requests that make sense - that are helpful for 
doing things in 'the unix way', then I may very well write 
some code for the task in question. If the situation were 
right I could take on some integration work for others, 
but I want to be completely clear that I am NOT a strong 
perl programmer by any stretch of the imagination.
